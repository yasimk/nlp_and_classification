# nlp_and_classification
Use NLP to do text parsing and try different classification algorithms to select the best algorithm.  The classification algorithms considered are as follows
1) Naive Bayes
2) Linear SVC
3) Random Forest
4) Decision Tree
5) K-Nearest Neighbor

The detailed use case behind analyzing these algorithm and deciding the best multiclass algorithm is explained here. I recommend going through this link prior to going over the Python code.
